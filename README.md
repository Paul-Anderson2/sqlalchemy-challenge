Module 10 challenge
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.                            
The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.                      

Resources, like csv files and sql lite files are in the 'resources' folder.                   
Code is contained in two separate files  : climate_working.ipynb for the first part and app.py for the second part.
